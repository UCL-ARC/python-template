# python-template

⚠️ This repository is still under construction! ⚠️

This is a Python package template for new ARC projects.
It automatically creates new Python packages with the recommended tooling set up and ready to go.
The recommended tooling is documented on the [UCL-ARC/python-tooling website](http://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/python-tooling/).

If you're making a package within a community that has an existing package template (e.g., [`scikit-hep`](https://github.com/scikit-hep/cookie)), we recommend using their template instead of this one.
