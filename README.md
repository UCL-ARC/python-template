This is a Python package template for new ARC Python packages.
It automatically creates new Python packages with the recommended tooling set up and ready to go.
The recommended tooling is documented on the [UCL-ARC/python-tooling website](http://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/python-tooling/).

If you're making a package within a community that has an existing package template (e.g., [`scikit-hep`](https://github.com/scikit-hep/cookie)), we recommend using their template instead of this one.
